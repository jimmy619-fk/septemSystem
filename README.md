# Task Management System

# Overview

The Task Management System is a web application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It includes features such as user authentication, task creation, updates, deletion, and deadline notifications. The system also incorporates rate limiting to prevent abuse, along with Swagger documentation for easy API reference.

# Important points

-Only admin can delete tasks (There is a protectedApi middleware which will detect user is admin or not)

- taskâ€™s deadline is near (less than 1 hour remaining), Using nodemailer gmail service notifications will be sended to users. (In future we can implement batching in this. Incase if we want to scale the system) (This is tested Will provide the screen shot as well)

- API Rate Limiting is implemented (express-rate-limit)
  1- Users can create up to 20 tasks per hour (rate limit applied).
  2- Users cannot register or log in more than 5 times within 15 minutes (rate limit applied).

- Task Fetching: Indexing and pagination have been implemented to improve the speed and efficiency of data retrieval. (user can filter by status (pending/completed))

# Database design

- Mongoose is used for schema
- Two collections: Users and Tasks. (Users can have multiple tasks)
